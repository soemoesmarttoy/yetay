# Our Crest

The phrase "Berkhidmat Dengan Keahlian" (a Malay phrase) means "To serve with skill" was suggested by Dr Toh Chin Chye (then Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore and Chairman of the Board of Governors of Singapore Polytechnic) at a Board of Governors' meeting held on 7 Jan 1960. It signified the educational mission of the Polytechnic. As Malay was and is still our National Language, the motto was implemented in Malay.

In 2014, the translation was updated. “To serve with mastery” reaffirms our unique strength as a polytechnic. The Malay phrase remains unchanged as “keahlian” can be translated as “mastery” too. We want our graduates to eventually achieve mastery in their chosen specialization and profession through dedication and practice; and to use this mastery to serve, improve lives and make an impact on society.

Dr Toh had also recommended the colours of the Polytechnic: Blue and pale violet or Red and yellow. SP's Board of Governors adopted the present crest on 17 May, 1960. It is in the form of a shield, red and yellow in colour. As a whole, the crest is intended to highlight the importance of the development of technology in Singapore.
