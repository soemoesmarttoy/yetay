Who Says Females Can’t Thrive In IT?

At a young age, a Korean drama series featuring a team of cyber investigators who solved cybercrimes fascinated Chua Min Min. The teenager realised how cybercrimes can wreak havoc on the world and understood the importance of cybersecurity in an ever evolving high-tech world. Despite this new realisation, Min Min had her heart set on studying accountancy as she was interested in the subject since primary school.

However, Min Min’s curiosity for technology did not wane. After consulting her secondary school teacher and with his encouragement, Min Min took a leap of faith and applied for Singapore Polytechnic (SP)’s Diploma in Infocomm Security Management (DISM) as her first choice. Looking back, she had no regrets.

SP gave Min Min the opportunity to work with the DSO National Laboratories for her final year project. Her team used open source tools and conducted Artificial Intelligence assisted penetration testing, to assess vulnerabilities in the cybersecurity systems. Even though it was a real-life project, Min Min tapped on the skills and knowledge she picked up in her course and took to the project like a fish to water.

Her skills were further tested during her internship at Assure IT Pte Ltd – a company specialising in technology governance, risk and compliance. As an Information Technology (IT) Audit Assistant intern, Min Min was exposed to IT auditing, an area which she was interested in. Min Min enjoyed her internship and impressed her supervisor with her can-do attitude and willingness to learn, who subsequently offered her a full-time role after graduation.

During her time in SP, Min Min also took on various roles at IT events including the prestigious Black Hat Asia 2019 and Governance, Technology Audit, Control, Security (GTACS) Conference 2019. These events allowed Min Min to build a network of like-minded individuals who are part of Singapore’s cybersecurity efforts. The exposure deepened her resolve to work in the IT industry.

Besides focusing on her studies, Min Min also found joy and fulfilment in mentoring others, including her peers who were academically weaker. Her mentoring efforts started during her time in Bukit Panjang Government High School and continued in SP, where she actively participated in the BP Mentoring Club. Eventually Min Min reached the position of Assistant School Coordinator. Her leadership role saw her conducting and planning activities for primary school students at the care centre she is overseeing, including weekly sessions to help mentees finish their schoolwork.

Min Min aspires to make a mark in the tech industry and intends to dispel the notion that successful females in the IT industry cannot raise a loving family. Min Min hopes to be a role model, inspiring young girls and women to join the field. For now, the aspiring IT auditor will be furthering her studies at the Nanyang Technological University in computer science with a minor in business. Here’s to girl power in helping Singapore become the world’s first Smart Nation.
