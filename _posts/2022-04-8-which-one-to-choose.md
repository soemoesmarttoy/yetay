Who Am I
I was born with brittle bone disease. A trip or fall could be dangerous for me and I use a wheelchair for my safety. By the time I was in Secondary Four, I already underwent multiple operations to strengthen my bones or to fix my injuries.

Despite these challenges, I wanted to contribute to the community as much as an able-bodied person could.  Even though I had no prior knowledge about programming, I wanted to explore how Information Technology (IT) could be used to help others. Thus, I enrolled into SP’s Diploma in Business Information Technology course as part of the pioneer cohort of the Polytechnic Foundation Programme.

What Have I Achieved
During my time in SP, I took part in IT competitions such as the Data-Driven Innovation Challenge organised by the Info-communications Media Development Authority and the Transport & Youth Hackathon organised by the Land Transport Authority.

Along with my classmates, we developed an application called “Happy Wheel” that leveraged on publicly available data sets to suggest wheelchair-friendly paths to various locations. Our efforts were rewarded with the People's Choice Award at the Transport & Youth Hackathon and commended by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his Facebook post.

I was also awarded the Microsoft Youthspark Scholarship which supported promising youths with disabilities in IT-related fields and was given the opportunity to represent SP at the WorldSkills Singapore 2016 competition.

My Next Step
I will be pursuing a Degree in Information Systems at the Singapore Management University.
