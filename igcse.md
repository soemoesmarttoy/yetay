# Benefits of a Cambridge education

Wherever in the world your students want to go, help them get there with Cambridge IGCSE. 

We created Cambridge IGCSE more than 30 years ago. Today, it’s the world’s most popular international qualification for 14 to 16 year olds. Not only is it truly international - it gives students more options than any other international qualification. That means more subjects to choose from, more ways to learn and more ways to succeed.

We align the standards of Cambridge IGCSE with the GCSE qualification taken in England.
